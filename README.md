CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

The frontend development that was used for this project includes Express, JavaScript, and Angular. Express was used for the HTML and styling. JavaScript was used for the website application and its interaction with other components. Angular is used for the admin SPA so that multiple pages do not need to be rendered. The back end uses NoSQL MongoDB because it is easy to use and intigrates well with the front end components that are being used.

JSON is used to store trip data while JavaScript is used to interact with different components and for methods. I needed to change the imports through refractoring when I moved files and I also condensed variables that did the same job through refractoring. 

In a full stack project, methods work like in any other program. They are used to automatically do a process when they are called. In the case of this project they are used for buttons, and to update the SPA so that the page does not need to be rerendered. They are also used in security to along with endpoint so that the connections between the client and server. 

This course has given me new skills in terms of marketing myself as a well-rounded developer. In today's business world there is a growing demand for websites that are both functional and stylish so this course has given me skills needed for part of that. I have learned about front end and back end design, while I also learned about SPA which I did not even know exsisted before taking this course.
